## Hackaday-Specific Affectations

* Voice: We write in the first-person plural.  We are Hackaday!  

    * We make an exception for long-form or personal opinion pieces, your own experience that's not likely to be shared across HaD, and rants.  This is a fine line.  "When I got malaria in the jungle." vs. "We love open-source projects."
    * Err on the side of "we" for blog posts.  

* Hacker names, pseudonyms, and handles are enclosed in square brackets.  This was originally intended to disambiguate "that nerdy hacker" from "[that nerdy hacker]".  It's not necessary for figures of historical importance, so you don't have to write [Albert Einstein], but you may.

* The first link in a blog post goes to the referenced web resource.  This can make writing an introductory paragraph contrived sometimes.  Sorry about that, but our readers expect to be able to click through on the top link.

* Attribution: We do it whenever possible.  If you read about something  (more here)

* Tipsters: We thank them.   (More here)

* Copyright notices. (More here)

* References to any Web resource is included in the body text as an HTML link.  If you're making a reference to a printed book, best is usually to cite it in text (see "Understanding Digital Signal Processing" by Richard G. Lyons).  If you have enough non-Web citations to warrant a bibliography, you can use a [1] notation.  Talk to an editor if you do this.

## Hackaday Specific Layout Trivia

* Never use two headings in a row -- it looks horrible with our style.  Come up with an introductory paragraph to lead off the new section.

* Don't tell the reader where the image is ("as you see in the figure to the left") because editors often move images, and they may move around on their own in a (future) mobile-first Web design.  You _can_ presume that the reader can see the image, though, and you can refer to it. 

## Tenses and Voices

* Active voice is preferred over passive voice.  "Next, [Joe] flashed his firmware into the Arduino" instead of "Next, the firmware was flashed into the Arduino".

* If the post is written describing actions that occurred in the past, it's reasonable that they should be written up in the past tense.

* Sometimes, writers like to tell a narrative in the present tense.  If you try to do this, stay consistent.  

## Genders

* There is no singular, gender-neutral pronoun in English that refers to people.  This sucks.  
    * If you can find out the hacker's preferred gender, don't be afraid to use it.
    * "He or she" is acceptable, but sounds stilted. 
    * Using the hacker's name can help: "[Pat] flashed the firmware".
    * If you're really stumped, you can re-construct the sentence in the passive voice.  "The firmware was flashed."  It's not as nice as the active version, but it's probably the lesser of two evils.  
    * "They" is plural.  (Anyone want to talk about this? I'd be stoked to change my mind. It would be handy, because the hacker's gender is often irrelevant, and it's just a hassle.)

* Go with the gender that the hacker identifies him or herself as.  He or she gets to choose, not you.  

## Punctuation, and its (Ab)uses

* Commas come in the sentence where you would take a breath or pause for a beat. 

    * Commas separate independent clauses: "She's smart, and she wields a mean soldering iron." 
    * Commas separate list elements: "butter, flour, and milk".  
    * Hackaday style is to use the [serial comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) -- the one just before the "and" -- in lists.  The best justification I've ever seen for this is the sentence "I love my parents, Lady Gaga and Humpty Dumpty".  
    * Commas offset parenthetical elements in a sentence: "[john doe], who we've featured before, is an anonymous hacker."

* The hyphen (single dash) makes a single unit out of two or more words, when the compound word modifies another and it's needed for clarity. It's like parentheses in math, but for language. 
    * "his awesome 3D-printing skills".  "3D-printing" modifies skills, but it's two words, and you could be confused if he had awesome, 3D, (printing skills).  A "flat-bed truck" is not a flat (bed truck).
    * Contrast: No dash in "3D printing is awesome" because 3D is a single word modifying printing.
    * The dash is _never_ needed when an adverb is one of the modifiers: "his simply fantastic prose" is fine, even though it's parsed as "(simply fantastic) prose".  The fact that it's an adverb is your clue that there are multiple modifiers at work.  
    * The hyphen is also used in ranges. "Pages 12-18", "1971-2007", etc.

* The em-dash (double dash) is an informal substitute for the parenthetical comma above.  It should be used in cases that are just slightly more parenthetical.  They should be offset on either side with a space.  "He hacked a Furby -- for whatever reason -- into a router."

* Parentheses are for material that doesn't fit the normal flow of the sentence.   In practice, when you have something to say that doesn't work in the sentence, it's best to split your sentence in two and re-write the parenthetical part so that it can stand on its own. If you absolutely can't, parenthesize. Entire parenthetical sentences, or asides, are useful if you are inserting your own opinion in piece that is otherwise written with the "Hackaday We" (he said).

* Semicolons separate two complete sentences that nonetheless are part of a unitary whole.  They're a strange beast, but useful when you need them.  "I'd like a wheat beer; my dog will have the IPA."  Unlike the period, the second sentence is not capitalized. 

* Regular colons precede: lists, descriptions, definitions, and explanations.  I can't tell you why: it simply is that way.  

* Ellipses.  You probably don't need 'em except in excerpts of direct quotations.  


## Numbers:

* Spell out numbers less than or equal to twenty.  "Seventeen frogs", and not "17 frogs".  

    * Do the same with units.  "Seven megabytes" but "28 GB".
    * When mixing and matching, the digits win out.  "He took between 17 and 25 hours" is more readable than "he took between seventeen and 25 hours". 
    

## Units:

We [follow the NIST](https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/writing-metric-units) on this one. Here is the [NIST long version](https://www.nist.gov/physical-measurement-laboratory/special-publication-811), and here's our short version:

* "15 MHz", not "fifteen MHz" or "15MHz" or whatever else.  "5 V at 17 A".

* "15 MHz to 17 MHz" is preferable to "15 to 17 MHz". Although this hasn't been the case in the past, it's what the NIST wants, and who are we to argue?

* Spaces around equals signs.  "I = 12 cm", not "I=12 cm".

* Capitalization of full unit names: the only one capitalized is Celsius.  "Twelve watts, fifteen pascals."

* Capitalization of abbreviated unit names: all lower-case, except those derived from a person's name.  (Inconsistent with the above!)  "12 W, 15 Pa, 1,000 A, 17.5 V".

* Capitalization of [prefixes](https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/prefixes): they're all lower-case below Mega, and all upper-case above.  12 kÎ© is twelve kilohms.  

* KiB vs kB: 1024 bytes vs 1000 bytes, [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte).  Do we want to go down this road?  Are we going to go as far as to write out "four [mebibytes](http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)" when called upon to do so?   

* KB vs kb vs KiB vs Kibit: Bytes vs bits, compounding the above issue. NIST has "Kibibyte" (KiB) and "Kibit" (Kibit) as the IEC standard.   I believe I have never seen "Kibit" before in my life.  

## Acronyms

Define an acronym on first use.  "Did you know that using a real-time operating system (RTOS) can make your programming life easier?  An RTOS is..."

* Exceptions are widely-known acronyms, where you'd just feel silly writing them out: "16 GB RAM", for instance.  This is a moving target.  This section needs fleshing out, or maybe just a list of the acronyms that _don't_ need spelling out.


## Capitalization:

In general, proper nouns are capitalized.

If it's a trademark, we defer to the entity that owns it for capitalization rules.  This can require some sleuthing: eBay's logo is lowercase, but their [corporate page](https://www.ebayinc.com/) consistently writes "eBay".  

Un-owned proper nouns are even more slippery.  We defer to Wikipedia on this one.

Here is a list of proper nouns / names that appear often, and this is how they're capitalized.  

* YouTube
* Internet
* the Web
* Ethernet
* Bluetooth
* WiFi
* eBay 
* GitHub
* DEFCON
* mbed
* G-code
* GNU
* Emacs
* GCC 
* Arduino

Acronyms that you'd think are capitalized, but have fallen out of fashion:

* laser 
* radar
* sonar
* scuba


Maybe this should be spun off into its own page.
