## Hackaday-Specific Affectations

* Voice: We write in the first-person plural.  We are Hackaday!  

    * We make an exception for personal opinion pieces and rants.  This is a fine line.  Err on the side of "we" for blog posts.

* Hacker names, pseudonyms, and handles are enclosed in square brackets.  This was originally intended to disambiguate "that nerdy hacker" from "[that nerdy hacker]".  It's not necessary for figures of historical importance, so you don't have to write [Albert Einstein], but you may.

* Attribution: We do it whenever possible.  If you read about something 

* Tipsters: We thank them.  

## Punctuation, and its (Ab)uses


* Commas come in the sentence where you would take a breath or pause for a beat. 

    * They separate independent clauses: "She's smart, and she wields a mean soldering iron." 

    * They separate list elements: "butter, flour, and milk"  Hackaday style is to use the [serial comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) -- the one just before the "and" -- in lists.  

    * They offset parenthetical elements in a sentence: "[john doe], who we've featured before, is an anonymous hacker."

* The em-dash (double-dash) is an informal substitute for the parenthetical comma above.  It maybe should be used in cases that are just slightly more parenthetical.  

* Parentheses.  Ugh.  In a sentence, they're for parenthetical remarks that are even less related to the topic at hand than those offset with commas.  In practice, when you have something to say that doesn't fit in the flow of the sentence, it's best to split your sentence in two and re-write the parenthetical part so that it doesn't interfere with the flow anymore.  Entire parenthetical sentences, that don't fit in the flow of the paragraph, are marginally acceptable, but please exercise restraint.  The logical flow of the article is paramount.  Parentheses are a crutch.

* Semicolons separate two complete sentences that nonetheless are part of a unitary whole.  They're a strange beast, but useful when you need them.  "I'd like a wheat beer; my dog will have the IPA."  Unlike the period, the second sentence is not capitalized. 


* Regular colons precede: lists, descriptions, definitions, and explanations.  I can't tell you why: it simply is that way.  

* Ellipses.  You probably don't need 'em.

## Hackaday Specific Layout Trivia

* Never use two headings in a row -- it looks horrible with our style.  

## Images


* Blog-post Images:

    * The "featured" image at the top of a single-post page is ideally 800 px wide and 350 px tall.  Taller images (up to 450?) work when necessary for the image.

    * The "thumbnail" image (600 px X 600 px) goes on the front page of Hackaday and is sent out over social media magics.  It's very important that it's graphic and catchy.

    * The "blogview" image is 800 px X 250 px.  No exceptions.  It's automatically derived from the center slice of the featured image, so if that's got some padding on the top and bottom, you don't have to provide one.  If someone's head appears at the top of the featured image, however, they will be decapitated in the blogview.  Ouch!  Here, you'll want to crop one specifically.



## Numbers:

* Spell out numbers less than or equal to twenty.  "Seventeen frogs", and not "17 frogs".  

    * Oh the exceptions! 

    * In "he took between 17 and 25 hours", it would look silly if you spelled out 17.  

## Units:

We [follow the NIST](https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/writing-metric-units) on this one. Here is the [NIST long version](https://www.nist.gov/physical-measurement-laboratory/special-publication-811), and here's our short version:

* "15 MHz", not "fifteen MHz" or "15MHz" or whatever else.  "5 V at 17 A".

* "15 MHz to 17 MHz" is preferable to "15 to 17 MHz". Although this hasn't been the case in the past, it's what the NIST wants, and who are we to argue?

* Spaces around equals signs.  "I = 12 cm", not "I=12 cm".

* Capitalization of full unit names: the only one capitalized is Celsius.  "Twelve watts, fifteen pascals."

* Capitalization of abbreviated unit names: all lower-case, except those derived from a person's name.  (Inconsistent with the above!)  "12 W, 15 Pa, 1,000 A, 17.5 V".

* Capitalization of [prefixes](https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/prefixes): they're all lower-case below Mega, and all upper-case above.  12 kÎ© is twelve kilohms.  

* KB vs kB.  (I hate this one.)  Some computer-science types will insist that one of these refers to 1,000 bytes while the other refers to 1,024 bytes.  These people are unaware that their choice conflicts with the use of capitalization in actual science. Screw them.  If you care about the extra 24 bytes, you're better off writing the number out in full.
