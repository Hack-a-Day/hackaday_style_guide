## Hackaday Howto

If you haven't already, go look at the [Hackaday Contributor Quick-Start Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LcUHBzFs0kHmT7zhJa6RcHX_XIC5TYAMjvlCsBobRGo/edit).  That document covers the mechanics of the tip line, working with Wordpress, and so on -- the really important stuff.  

This style guide is dedicated to the minutiae.  Is it "gcode" or "G-code"?  One dash or two?  Active or passive voice?  Read on to find out!

## Hackaday-Specific Affectations

* Voice: We write in the first-person plural.  We are Hackaday!  

    * We make an exception for long-form or personal opinion pieces, your own experience that's not likely to be shared across HaD, and rants.  This can be a fine line sometimes.  "When I got malaria in the jungle." vs. "We love open-source projects." is pretty clear.
    * Err on the side of "we" for blog posts.  

* We use one space after a period, not two.  

* Hacker names, pseudonyms, and handles are enclosed in square brackets.  This was originally intended to disambiguate "that nerdy hacker" from "[that nerdy hacker]".  It's not necessary for figures of historical importance, so you don't have to write [Albert Einstein], but you may.

* The first link in a blog post goes to the referenced web resource.  This can make writing an introductory paragraph contrived sometimes.  Sorry about that, but our readers expect to be able to click through on the top link.

* The Wikimedia copyright notice is unnecessarily verbose.  We use <pre>"Image title" by <a href="http://mediapage.Url">Creator</a> CC-BY-SA 3.0</pre>

* Attribution: We do it whenever possible.  If you read about it somewhere, include: (Is this already in Quick-start Guide?)
* Tipsters: We thank them.   (More here)

* References to any Web resource is included in the body text as an HTML link.  If you're making a reference to a printed book, best is usually to cite it in text: (See _Understanding Digital Signal Processing_ by Richard G. Lyons).  If you have enough non-Web citations to warrant a bibliography, you can use a [1] notation.  Talk to an editor if you do this.

## Hackaday Specific Layout Trivia

* Never use two headings in a row -- it looks bad with our style.  Come up with an introductory paragraph to lead off the new section.

* Don't tell the reader where the image is ("as you see in the figure to the left") because editors often move images, and they may move around on their own in a (future) mobile-first Web design.  You _can_ presume that the reader can see the image, though, and you can refer to it.

## Tenses and Voices

* Active voice is preferred over passive voice.  "Next, [Joe] flashed his firmware into the Arduino" instead of "Next, the firmware was flashed into the Arduino".

* If the post is written describing actions that occurred in the past, it's reasonable that they should be written up in the past tense.

* Sometimes, writers like to tell a narrative in the present tense.  If you try to do this, stay consistent.  

## Genders

* English has a very interesting and intersectional history where pronouns are concerned. Here are a few tips for how to navigate the fields of gender and pronouns in writing:
    * If you can find out the hacker's preferred gender, don't be afraid to use it. Some individuals use pronouns you might not have heard of [(xem, xyr)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/contenthub-static/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/11.jpg) as a linguistic representation of the [non-binary](https://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/40428_Chapter2.pdf) [nature](https://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/40428_Chapter2.pdf) of [gender](https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/09/pregnant-males-and-pseudopenises-complex-sex-in-the-animal-kingdom/).
    * When you're unsure, using the hacker's name can help: "[Pat] flashed the firmware".
    * "They" is [generally](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they) [accepted](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/usage/he-or-she-versus-they) as a [gender-neutral](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/education/edlife/a-university-recognizes-a-third-gender-neutral.html?_r=1) [singular/plural](http://www.npr.org/2016/01/13/462906419/everyone-uses-singular-they-whether-they-realize-it-or-not) pronoun among linguists: "the use of plural pronouns to refer back to a singular subject isn’t new: it represents a revival of a practice dating from the 16th century. It’s increasingly common in current English and is now widely accepted both in speech and in writing."- [Oxford Living Dictionary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/usage/he-or-she-versus-they). Moreover, [some individuals](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/use-the-singular-they/) prefer the they/them as personal pronouns over the historically dominant he/him or she/her pronouns. For these reasons, "they" was voted as the [word of the year](http://www.americandialect.org/2015-word-of-the-year-is-singular-they) for 2015 by the [American Dialect Society](http://www.americandialect.org/).

](http://www.gsafewi.org/wp-content/uploads/Why-Pronouns-Matter.pdf), [The Need for a Gender-Neutral Pronoun](https://genderneutralpronoun.wordpress.com/2010/01/24/the-need-for-a-gender-neutral-pronoun/), [Pronouns](https://lgbt.williams.edu/resources/trans-resources/pronouns/)
    * Examples of the use of they/them include:
      * "Each and every one of my colleagues at the university will express their own opinion."
      * "Everyone was absorbed in their own business."
      * "Nobody wants to return to the car park and find that their car has been clamped." Quotes from the [Oxford Living Dictionary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/using-they-and-them-in-the-singular)
    * If you're really stumped, you can re-construct the sentence in the passive voice.  "The firmware was flashed."  It's not as nice as the active version "They flashed the firmware", but it's probably the lesser of two evils.

* Go with the gender that the hacker identifies themselves as.  They get to choose, not you.  

## Punctuation, and its (Ab)uses

* Commas come in the sentence where you would take a breath or pause for a beat. This does not mean that every pause requires a comma.

    * Commas separate independent clauses: "She is smart, and she wields a mean soldering iron."
    * Commas don't separate two actions that occur in sequence: "She finished her tee and left."
    * Commas separate list elements: "sex, drugs, and Arduinos".  
    * Hackaday style is to use the [serial comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) -- the one just before the "and" -- in lists.  The best justification I've ever seen for this is the sentence "I love my parents, Lady Gaga and Humpty Dumpty".  
    * Commas offset parenthetical elements in a sentence: "[john doe], who we've featured before, is an anonymous hacker."

* The hyphen (single dash) makes a single unit out of two or more words, when the compound word modifies another and it's needed for clarity. It's like parentheses in math, but for language.
    * "his awesome 3D-printing skills".  "3D-printing" modifies skills, but it's two words, and you could be confused if he had awesome, 3D, (printing skills).  A "flat-bed truck" is not a flat (bed truck).
    * Contrast: No dash in "3D printing is awesome" because 3D is a single word modifying printing.
    * The dash is _never_ needed when an adverb is one of the modifiers: "his simply fantastic prose" is fine, even though it's parsed as "(simply fantastic) prose".  The fact that it's an adverb is your clue that there are multiple modifiers at work.  
    * The hyphen is also used in ranges. "Pages 12-18", "1971-2007", etc.

* The em-dash (double dash) is an informal substitute for the parenthetical comma above.  It should be used in cases that are just slightly more parenthetical.  They should be offset on either side with a space.  "He hacked a Furby -- for whatever reason -- into a router."

* Parentheses are for material that doesn't fit the normal flow of the sentence.   In practice, when you have something to say that doesn't work in the sentence, it's best to split your sentence in two and re-write the parenthetical part so that it can stand on its own. If you absolutely can't, parenthesize.
    * Entire parenthetical sentences, or asides, are useful if you are inserting your own opinion in piece that is otherwise written with the "Hackaday We" (he said).
    * Flag links to something other than a webpage with parentheses: "For details, check the documentation (PDF)." Or "[Meatballman7000] has a great video (YouTube)..."
    * Definitions and clarifications can work with parentheses. "He danced the cha-cha (a derivative of the mambo) until dawn."

* Semicolons separate two complete sentences that nonetheless are part of a unitary whole.  They're a strange beast, but useful when you need them.  "I'd like a wheat beer; my dog will have the IPA."  Unlike the period, the second sentence is not capitalized.

* Regular colons precede: lists, descriptions, definitions, and explanations.  I can't tell you why: it simply is that way.  

* Ellipses.  You probably don't need 'em except in excerpts of direct quotations.  Letting your thoughts trail off in ellipses is sloppy.  Take the time to finish the sentence.


## Numbers:

* Spell out numbers less than or equal to twenty.  "Seventeen frogs", and not "17 frogs".  

    * Do the same with units.  "Seven megabytes" but "28 GB".
    * Seventeenth, but 23rd.  
    * When mixing and matching, the digits win out.  "He took between 17 and 25 hours" is more readable than "he took between seventeen and 25 hours".
    * Exceptions:
        * When the number is the name: "Pin 5" or "Pier 17".
	* Bits.  We've used "8-bit" forever.  No reason to change.

* Years: "1980s" or "'80s".  (Not possessive.)

* Commas every thousand help readability.  "3,542".  


## Units:

We [follow the NIST](https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/writing-metric-units) on this one. Here is the [NIST long version](https://www.nist.gov/physical-measurement-laboratory/special-publication-811), and here's our short version:

* "15 MHz", not "fifteen MHz" or "15MHz" or whatever else.  "5 V at 17 A".

* "15 MHz to 17 MHz" is preferable to "15 to 17 MHz". Although this hasn't been the case in the past, it's what the NIST wants, and who are we to argue?

* Spaces around equals signs.  "I = 12 cm", not "I=12 cm".

* Capitalization of full unit names: the only ones capitalized are Celsius and Fahrenheit, because they're really "degrees Celsius" and "degrees Fahrenheit".  So "twelve watts, seven ohms, and fifteen pascals."

* Capitalization of abbreviated unit names: all lower-case, except those derived from a person's name.  (Inconsistent with the above!)  "12 W, 15 Pa, 1,000 A, 17.5 V".

* Capitalization of [prefixes](https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/prefixes): they're all lower-case below Mega, and all upper-case above.  12 kΩ is twelve kilohms.  

* KiB vs kB: 1024 bytes vs 1000 bytes, [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte).  Do we want to go down this road?  Are we going to go as far as to write out "four [mebibytes](http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)" when called upon to do so?   

* KB vs kb vs KiB vs Kibit: Bytes vs bits, compounding the above issue. NIST has "Kibibyte" (KiB) and "Kibit" (Kibit) as the IEC standard.   I believe I have never seen "Kibit" before in my life.  Is it really the case that the abbreviation is the same as the full unit?    

## Acronyms

Define an acronym on first use.  "Did you know that using a real-time operating system (RTOS) can make your programming life easier?  An RTOS is..."

* Exceptions are widely-known acronyms, where you'd just feel silly writing them out: "16 GB RAM", for instance.  This is a moving target.  This section needs fleshing out, or maybe just a list of the acronyms that _don't_ need spelling out.

## Miscellanea

* That / which: "That" is for details that are essential to the meaning of the sentence, and "which" is for additional info.  "To defuse the bomb, cut the wire that is flagged with tape."  "To defuse the bomb, which was planted by [Evil McNasty], our hero cut the wire."  You need to know which wire, but you don't need to know who planted the bomb, at least for the meaning of the sentence.



## Capitalization:

In general, proper nouns are capitalized.

If it's a trademark, we defer to the entity that owns it for capitalization rules.  This can require some sleuthing: eBay's logo is lowercase, but their [corporate page](https://www.ebayinc.com/) consistently writes "eBay".  

Un-owned proper nouns are even more slippery.  We defer to Wikipedia on this one.

Here is a list of proper nouns / names that appear often, and this is how they're capitalized.  

* YouTube
* Internet
* the Web
* Ethernet
* Bluetooth
* WiFi
* eBay
* GitHub
* DEF CON
* mbed
* G-code
* GNU
* Emacs
* GCC
* Arduino
* BlackBerry

Acronyms that you'd think are capitalized, but have fallen out of fashion:

* laser
* radar
* sonar
* scuba


Maybe this should be spun off into its own page.
